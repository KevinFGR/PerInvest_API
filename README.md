# PerInvest_API

- I'm developing this API to better manage my investments, especially Cryptocurrancy transactions.
- The first goal is implement a CRUD for Cryptocurrenies, followed by a CRUD for transactions
- the next step will be to create reports about my crypto portfolio status such as
    - The current value of each Cryptocurrency
    - The percentage of appreciation compared to the purchase date
    - The total amount of money invested in each Cryptocurrency
